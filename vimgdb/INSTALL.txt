INSTALL.txt - VimGdb patch installation notes
This document describes how to install the patch for vimGdb.


a) You need:

    vim-7.2.tar.bz2         Vim 7.2 source tar ball (from www.vim.org)
    vimgdb72-1.14.tar.gz    this patch


b) Untar all files, apply the patch and make Vim:

    tar xjf vim-7.2.tar.bz2
    tar xzf vimgdb72-1.14.tar.gz

    patch -d vim72 --backup -p0 < vimgdb/vim72.diff

    cd vim72/src
        make	            make vim
        make install        install vim (may require root privileges)

IMPORTANT NOTE: you must run make (not ./configure), and if you run
./configure then you must add the --enable-gdb command line argument
in order to include the gdb feature (vimgdb) in vim.


c) Install vimGdb runtime:
Copy the file vimgdb_runtime.tgz found in the vimgdb tarball, to your
runtime path. To find your runtime path location execute the vim
command (this is usually $HOME/.vim):

    :set runtimepath?

Untar vimgdb_runtime.tgz in your runtime path. After this step, you
should have the following files:

    doc/gdb.txt
    macros/gdb_mappings.vim
    syntax/gdb.vim
    syntax/gdbvim.vim
    syntax/gdbvar.vim

Change to the doc directory, start Vim and run the ":helptags ."
command to process the taglist help file. Without this step, you
cannot jump to the taglist help topics. You can now use the ":help
vimgdb" command to get the vimGdb documentation.
